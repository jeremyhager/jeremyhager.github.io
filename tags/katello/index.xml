First thing that happened is I could not import errata correctly, and I tried 2 different scripts out there to accomplish it. After several re-tries, I figured a fresh start would be good and reverted the Foreman VM back to before all of these changes happened.
Well after going through the process again, I unfortunately ran into another issue: I tried to back up the server.</description></item><item><title>Polishing the website</title><link>https://yugawa.io/posts/2020-08-24-polishing-the-website/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yugawa.io/posts/2020-08-24-polishing-the-website/</guid><description>The website is almost finished! I feel I can start focusing on Linux again. I also read about RedHat Developer Subscription, which allows you to use RedHat for free, with some limitations of course.
I think I&amp;rsquo;ll continue using CentOS for now though. My thoughts are that forcing myself to learn the free and open versions of everything will help my understanding of how each component and package works with each other.</description></item></channel></rss>
