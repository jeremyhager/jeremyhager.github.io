After I tried installing the GUI to connect via VNC somewhere along the way I reconnected to ssh, and sure enough a little message popped up: Web console: https://centos8.lan:9090/ or https://192.168.86.41:9090/. I thought this a bit odd, then tested out to see if my suspicions were correct - could I use the web console to view the GUI on my Windows Server 2016 VM?</description></item><item><title>Installing a "headless" CentOS 7 VM</title><link>https://jeremyhager.github.io/posts/2020-08-11-headless-centos7-vm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jeremyhager.github.io/posts/2020-08-11-headless-centos7-vm/</guid><description>I found a section in the Unix and Linux Sysadmin Handbook about kickstart files - something I crossed by earlier when I was trying to get CentOS 7 to work on my homebuilt computer. However I was going through the book page-by-page at the time, and like I mentioned I felt like I was spending too much time on getting CentOS 7 to work on my homebuilt hardware.
An interesting error I kept running into when I first was trying to get the VM to work was ERROR Kernel arguments are only supported with location or kernel installs.</description></item><item><title>New milestone and setting up networks</title><link>https://jeremyhager.github.io/posts/2020-10-7-new-milestone-and-setting-up-networks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jeremyhager.github.io/posts/2020-10-7-new-milestone-and-setting-up-networks/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy! I created a new vm, dns-dhcp which will serve my dns and dhcp for the internal.virtnet environment. I configured dhcp to only hand out addresses to libvirt vms (they all start with 52:54:00), I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a few hours a day trying to find out why pxe boot wasn&amp;rsquo;t working on libvirt, and finally realized I had to create a new network for my environment.
This post will be a bit longer than my typical blog posts, as it is a culmination of the last few weeks.</description></item></channel></rss>
