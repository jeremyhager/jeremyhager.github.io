### Public documentation
Currently be found at: https://yugawa.xyz/docs. A [CI/CD](https://github.com/jeremyhager/yugawa-website/blob/master/.github/workflows/documentation.yml) is in place to automatically deploy code from the master branch to the gh-pages branch of this repository. 


### Main Setup
This website uses [Docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus): a "project for building, deploying, and maintaining open source project websites easily". It is an open-source project built by Facebook.

If you'd like to fork this website and start working on your own version, feel free to fork https://github.com/jeremyhager/yugawa-website.
After that, check the Docusaurus github page for instructions.

### Customizations
There are no major customizations of Docusaurus on this site, I enjoy keeping it boring in that aspect. 

### Further documentation servers
Eventually I will setup a [JBoss wiki](https://jbosswiki.jboss.org/), as per step 11 in the [Linux Sysadmin Guide](nixadmin-guide.md)

TODO
Find a way to automatically import server info later on. Foreman/Chef?
