# Hello!

Hello, I'm Jeremy Hager. Nice to meet you!

I am the Sr. IT Support Engineer at SkyKick - my responsibilities are focused on internal IT and range from making sure our WiFi is working, to setting up conference rooms, to help desk work, and everything in-between. You can view my full history and responsibilities on my LinkedIn page, linked below.

Internal IT at SkyKick is all Microsoft-based, so when I'm at home I'm diving into the world of open source enterprise. You can view the current documentation [here](/docs), otherwise if you'd like to read about my progress and approaches read about in the blog section of my website [here](/blog).

If you'd like to connect with me you can feel free to reach out via LinkedIn or follow me on GitHub.
