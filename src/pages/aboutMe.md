## Hello!
Hello, I'm Jeremy Hager. Nice to meet you!

I am the Sr. IT Support Engineer at SkyKick - my responsibilities are focused on internal IT and range from making sure our WiFi is working, to setting up conference rooms, to help desk work, and everything in-between. You can view my full history and responsibilities on my LinkedIn page, linked below.

Internal IT at SkyKick is all Microsoft-based, so when I'm at home I'm diving into the world of open source enterprise. You can view the current documentation [here](/docs), otherwise if you'd like to read about my progress and approaches read about in the blog section of my website [here](/blog).

If you'd like to connect with me you can feel free to reach out via LinkedIn or follow me on GitHub.

## Other blogs/sites that are interesting
As I discover good blogs/sites to use for reference I'll put them here.

1. https://www.lisenet.com/
    - Active blog, has a series that is close to what I am trying that I may end up relying a bit on.
    - Fun fact: I was one of the people who found the easter egg.
    - Has a lot of guides and how-to's. Specifically interested in [RHCE](https://www.lisenet.com/rhce/) myself 


## Podcasts that I've enjoyed
I'm not much of a podcaster, but I do enjoy them from time-to-time. Here is a list of podcasts I have found personally interesting.

1. [Linux Unplugged](https://linuxunplugged.com/)
    - Very active, and interactive. They talk about interesting and cool projects, latest news about Linux and open-source.
    - Jupiter Broadcasting as a whole is really great.
2. [Admin Admin Podcast](https://www.adminadminpodcast.co.uk/)
    - Still updates, but only every so often. Their content is pretty good, and to me sounds like a group of people just talking about tech.
    - Works especially well if you like to feel a fly on the wall. Personally, I enjoy the format a quite a bit.
