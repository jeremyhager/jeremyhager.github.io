## Hello!
Hello, I'm Jeremy Hager. Nice to meet you!

I am the Sr. IT Support Engineer at my work - my responsibilities are focused on internal IT and range from making sure our WiFi is working, to setting up conference rooms, to help desk work, to setting up new accounts, and everything in-between. You can view my full history and responsibilities on my LinkedIn page, linked below.

Internal IT where I work is all Microsoft-based, so when I'm at home I'm diving into the world of open source enterprise. For my personal at-home environment, discoveries, and other personal accomplishments I've done I am documenting on this website. You can view the current documentation [here](/docs), or if you'd like to read about my progress and personal approaches read about in the blog section of the website [here](/blog).

If you'd like to connect with me you can feel free to reach out via LinkedIn or follow me on GitHub.

## Other blogs/sites that are interesting
As I discover good blogs/sites to use for reference I'll put them here.

1. https://www.lisenet.com/
    - Active blog, has a series that is close to what I am trying that I may end up relying a bit on.
    - Fun fact: I was one of the people who found the easter egg.
    - Has a lot of guides and how-to's. Specifically interested in [RHCE](https://www.lisenet.com/rhce/) myself 


## Podcasts that I've enjoyed
I'm not much of a podcaster, but I do enjoy them from time-to-time. Here is a list of podcasts I have found personally interesting.

1. [Linux Unplugged](https://linuxunplugged.com/)
    - Very active, and interactive. They talk about interesting and cool projects, latest news about Linux and open-source.
    - Jupiter Broadcasting as a whole is really great.
2. [Admin Admin Podcast](https://www.adminadminpodcast.co.uk/)
    - Still updates, but only every so often. Their content is pretty good, and to me sounds like a group of people just talking about tech.
    - Works especially well if you like to feel a fly on the wall. Personally, I enjoy the format a quite a bit.

## About the website
This website is using [Docusaurus v2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), an open-source project by Facebook. Their [GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus) page states:

> Docusaurus is a project for building, deploying, and maintaining open source project websites easily.

It also includes the ability to use a blog, which ended up being the prefect combination for my website.
