Hello! This is my first blog post on my new website. Feel free to have a look around, though it may feel a bit empty for now.

Last time I updated, I was trying to get [moinmoin](http://moinmo.in/) to work. As I began to try to get it to work I would was having a difficult time understanding the best way to use it, as well as getting it to work on its own vs. using it with Apache, etc. It seemed to work okay on an internal instance, but then I wondered if Facebook had created any open-sourced solution to this already.

Sure enough, after looking at their projects at their [open source website](https://opensource.facebook.com/projects#development-tools), I found [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). If it was good enough for Facebook, it certainly was good enough for me. Sure enough, it had exactly what I wanted:

* A blog page where I could update my thoughts.
* Doc site where I could begin documenting the environment I was working with.
* Flexible and intuitive enough I could change links easy.
* Static site to boot, so I could deploy to github pages and document my environment on my website!

I still have a bit to learn between markdown and how to use this website, but I think I'm getting the hang of it. Now that I have the [Docs](/Docs) section, I can keep this to my thoughts and opinions on what I'm doing, and keep the how-to style stuff in the Docs.

As for the old blogs, I've just manually copy+pasted them over and changed the references for the images. Otherwise, it was pretty easy to get this set up.
