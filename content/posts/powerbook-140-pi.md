I was watching Bill Nye The Science Guy one day, and noticed something interesting: he started talking about the Nobel Prize, and was using a cool retro notebook! I had to pause it and take another look:

Then I thought _hey, what if I repurposed one of these?_. Thus I fell down the rabbit hole of trying to figure out what macintosh he had (probably some sort of powerbook, as the episode came out in 1993 and filming would have been done within a year so maybe powerbook in 1992?), then if anyone else had taken it apart and tried to use a powerbook with a raspberry pi and even looking online for repairs and guides.

Turns out someone had done this before, just with a different powerbook. Someone going by "Dan Jilek" on [hackaday](https://hackaday.io/project/173252-raspberry-pi-powerbook) had done a lot of this work. I followed along and bought all the parts I could think of that he mentioned, including of course the laptop. I spent about $100 on the laptop, really the case was what I was after. I found one that was in what I could see great condition, just missing the back door. Eventually, it arrived and appeared in good condition:
