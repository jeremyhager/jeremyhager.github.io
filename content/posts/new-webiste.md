Making a new website. I saw someone else had a similar website and really dig the way this one looks. Hopefully good things will come soon.
I got the idea when reading https://filipnikolovski.com/posts/thoughts-on-microservices. Toyed around with the css a little, trying to remove the margins and have everything left-aligned. I realized it was a little hard to read, so leaving default for now.

More to come in the coming months.
