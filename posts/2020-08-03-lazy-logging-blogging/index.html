<a href=/tags/linux>Linux</a><div><p>For now, just going to keep updating the README.md so I can keep a short list of interesting things I find on the internet that&rsquo;s helpful. Like a favorites bar but public.</p><p>Currently trying to learn more about Linux and going through <em>UNIX and Linux System Administration Handbook, 5th Edition</em>, while following a Reddit post about how to learn Enterprise Linux basics. You can find this by IConrad <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/2s924h/how_did_you_get_your_start/cnnw1ma/?context=3">here</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200803230945/https://old.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/2s924h/how_did_you_get_your_start/cnnw1ma/?context=3">archive</a>, in case it ever gets removed). I&rsquo;m going through the IConrad post and referencing the Linux handbook while I walk through, while trying to adjust as I go for more modern takes if possible.</p><p>One of the things I foresee wanting to do is bin packing (containers on VMs). Why? Well, as I am learning Enterprise basics I&rsquo;d like to scale the number of VMs I have from a dozen or two to several dozen if possible. Since Windows servers now come in containers I am thinking the best, most modern way of learning would this be route. It also allows me for future learning by migrating and testing these containers and VMs on a cloud provider. Finally I&rsquo;m not as worried about performance, which I&rsquo;d think would be a cause of concern.</p><h3 id=hows-linux-going>How&rsquo;s Linux going?</h3><p>Well I tried installing CentOS 7 1908 on my brand-new computer and every time I would select to install from the GRUB loader the computer would freeze. I started looking around and sure enough, if you look up intel 630 - the integrated graphics <a href=https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/199271/intel-core-i5-10400-processor-12m-cache-up-to-4-30-ghz.html>my CPU</a> uses - with Linux <a href=https://access.redhat.com/discussions/3410491>people have suggested</a> to boot with the flag <code>i915.alpha_support=1</code> in the GRUB loader. I tried that to no avail with several different options, as well as attempting to <a href=https://docs.centos.org/en-US/centos/install-guide/Text_Installation_Intro-x86/>install in Text Mode</a>. CentOS 7 would just keep freezing after every install.</p><p>I tried Centos 7 2003 next, but no dice (same issue, would freeze). Finally, I decided to boot to a Ubuntu 20.04 flash drive to see what was going on. Sure enough, that worked just fine. I did give a pretty honest effort to get CentOS 7 to work, in hopes I could just say &ldquo;I did it!&rdquo; or maybe even &ldquo;why yes I&rsquo;ve used CentOS 7&rdquo;, but I ended up installing CentOS 8 2004 and sure enough, the GUI came up and I was able to configure my machine. I suppose in the end I decided I wanted to get my hands into Linux quick and this seemed to do the trick. Besides, I could always install the VMs as Centos 7.</p><p>So, onward with learning!</p><h3 id=resources>Resources</h3><p>Here are some resources I am using to get Windows Server 2016 Core installed on Centos 8 2004 as a Guest VM:</p><ul><li><a href=https://taylor.dev/automating-windows-server-2016-installs/>Automating server 2016 install with unattend.xml</a> <em><a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803234543/https://taylor.dev/automating-windows-server-2016-installs/>archive</a></em></li><li><a href=https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/96683-create-media-automated-unattended-install-windows-10-a.html>Create media for automated unattended install of Windows 10</a> <em><a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20200323053542/https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/96683-create-media-automated-unattended-install-windows-10-a.html>archive</a></em></li><li><a href=https://linuxconfig.org/redhat-8-start-gui>How to start/install GUI on RHEL 8 / CentOS 8 Linux</a> <em><a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20190921143654/https://linuxconfig.org/redhat-8-start-gui>archive</a></em></li><li><a href=https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-and-configure-vnc-on-centos-8/>how to install and configure vnc on centOS 8</a> <em><a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803234555/https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-and-configure-vnc-on-centos-8/>archive</a></em></li></ul></div></article></main><aside><div><div><h3>LATEST POSTS</h3></div><div><ul><li><a href=/posts/2021-12-31-powerbook-140-pi/>Powerbook 140 Pi - Part 1</a></li><li><a href=/posts/2021-12-04-new-webiste/>New Webiste</a></li><li><a href=/posts/2020-08-05-windows-vm-with-libvirt/>Getting a Windows VM to work with libvirt</a></li><li><a href=/posts/2020-08-16-new-website/>Got a new website up and running!</a></li><li><a href=/posts/2020-08-11-headless-centos7-vm/>Installing a "headless" CentOS 7 VM</a></li></ul></div></div></aside><footer><p>&copy; 2024 <a href=https://yugawa.io><b>Jeremy Hager</b></a>.
