I had to pause it and take another look:
Then I thought hey, what if I repurposed one of these?. Thus I fell down the rabbit hole of trying to figure out what macintosh he had (probably some sort of powerbook, as the episode came out in 1993 and filming would have been done within a year so maybe powerbook in 1992?</description></item><item><title>New Webiste</title><link>https://jeremyhager.github.io/posts/2021-12-04-new-webiste/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 22:04:19 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jeremyhager.github.io/posts/2021-12-04-new-webiste/</guid><description>Making a new website. I saw someone else had a similar website and really dig the way this one looks. Hopefully good things will come soon. I got the idea when reading https://filipnikolovski.com/posts/thoughts-on-microservices. Toyed around with the css a little, trying to remove the margins and have everything left-aligned. I realized it was a little hard to read, so leaving default for now.
More to come in the coming months.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://jeremyhager.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 13:12:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jeremyhager.github.io/about/</guid><description>Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Jeremy Hager. Nice to meet you!
