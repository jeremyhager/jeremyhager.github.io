I saw someone else had a similar website and really dig the way this one looks. Hopefully good things will come soon. I got the idea when reading https://filipnikolovski.com/posts/thoughts-on-microservices. Toyed around with the css a little, trying to remove the margins and have everything left-aligned. I realized it was a little hard to read, so leaving default for now.
More to come in the coming months.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://yugawa.xyz/about/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 13:12:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://yugawa.xyz/about/</guid><description>Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Jeremy Hager. Nice to meet you!
